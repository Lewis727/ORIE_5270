    "Regular expressions are patterns that match characters in strings (called regex for short). They are a mix of \"ordinary\" characters (like substrings you wish to match exactly) and \"special\" characters that allow for repetitions, combinations, and other interesting features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are supported by several languages and command-line tools. For example, the grep utility in UNIX allows you to probe files for patterns using regular expression syntax, the sed utility allows you to perform substitutions using regular expressions, and so on. Python has a library called re to create regular expressions as well. During this part of the course, we will be putting on our UNIX hat and working with command-line tools but feel free to use Python to practice them in your spare time."
