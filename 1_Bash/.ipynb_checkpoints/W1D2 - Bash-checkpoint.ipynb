    "What is the shell? The shell is a program that exposes an OS's services to a user (or another program). Contrary to popular belief, what we call the shell is not the same as what is called the terminal. However, in Linux the main way to interact with the shell is via the terminal, which provides a command-line interface (meaning: not graphical) to the shell, which is why we will sometimes use the words \"shell\" and \"terminal\" interchangeably.\n",

    "There are serveral different shells available in Linux. Most distributions come with the `bash` shell. Other shells include `zsh`, `fish`, `tcsh`, `csh`."

    "To get started, fire up your distribution's terminal. Depending on your distribution, it might be called \"Terminal\", \"Console\" or some variant thereof. This will start a command-line interface (CLI) where you will be able to type commands and see their output. You should see something like the following (called the prompt):\n",

    "\n",
    "What does this mean? The shell keeps track of which user is currently logged and displays their login name (user). It also displays the name of the computer they are logged in to. The last piece of information is the working directory, which is the current location in your computer's filesystem. Here ~ is a special character that denotes your home directory (assuming one is defined; more on this later). Finally, anything on the left of the $ are commands that you type.\n",
